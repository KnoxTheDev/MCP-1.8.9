# MCP 1.8.9 - Minecraft Code Pack

## Overview

**MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack) 1.8.9** is a powerful tool for mod developers looking to modify and enhance Minecraft Java Edition. With MCP, you can decompile, modify, and recompile Minecraft's source code, making it easier to create your own mods and plugins. This repository provides all the necessary tools and resources for developing high-quality mods compatible with Minecraft 1.8.9.

## Features

- **Easy Mod Development**: Simplify the process of creating Minecraft mods using an intuitive interface.
- **Decompile and Recompile**: Access and modify Minecraft's source code with ease.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
- **Community-Driven**: Engage with a vibrant community of Minecraft modders for support and collaboration.
- **Documentation and Tutorials**: Comprehensive guides to help you get started with modding.

## Installation

1. **Download MCP**: Get the latest version of MCP 1.8.9 from the [Releases](https://github.com/KnoxTheDev/MCP-1.8.9/releases) page.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file into a directory of your choice.
3. **For GitHub Codespaces Users**: Run start.sh with sudo perms to setup Java 8, a noVNC sever and LegacyLauncher to test Minecraft with GUI.

**Note**: The .sh files don't work as Python 3 is installed at default, so use commands like *python2.7 ./runtime/thescript.py*, to do things, except start.sh which is the setup file.

## Getting Started

- **Setup Your Environment**: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) (8 at minimum) installed.
- **Community Resources**: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/) for additional support.
